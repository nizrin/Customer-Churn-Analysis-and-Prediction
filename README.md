Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

üìå Overview

Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over time. This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns and predicting whether a customer is likely to leave using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses identify factors leading to churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.

üìä Dataset

The dataset contains customer information, service details, and churn status.

Features include demographics, account details, usage patterns, and customer engagement metrics.

The target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

üìà Project Workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation

Load the dataset using pandas.

Handle missing values and perform data cleaning.

Convert categorical variables into numerical form (one-hot encoding or label encoding).

Feature scaling using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing customer distribution using matplotlib and seaborn.

Understanding feature relationships with correlation matrices and pair plots.

Identifying key factors contributing to churn.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Splitting & Feature Selection

Split data into training and testing sets (train_test_split from sklearn).

Use feature selection techniques to retain relevant features.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection & Training

Train different machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost)

Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation

Evaluate models using metrics like:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC Curve

Confusion Matrix


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
